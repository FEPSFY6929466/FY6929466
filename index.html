<p class="ex1">
  In the computer industry, performance has traditionally been the main focus. This has led to computer hardware being less energy efficient due to chasing performance gains by increasing power draw. 
  Power-efficient hardware carries a lot of benefits which are often overlooked, including being more environmentally friendly, due to lower energy demand. This is especially more relevant as the demand for energy 
  from datacentres has increased as a result of AI. Power-efficiency allows for more practicality by enabling longer battery life and thinner portable devices. Furthermore, lower operating voltages improve reliability 
  by reducing degradation, such as by the means of electromigration, as seen in recent failures of intel 13th/14th generation processors. This study highlights the fact that power efficiency should be more of a focus 
  than it currently is and concludes that  prioritizing power efficiency allows for computing to be more sustainable, practical and reliable.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p class="ex1" id= "Introduction_InText">
  Power efficiency is often an overlooked area in computing. This is because the highest level of performance is achieved when higher amounts of power are supplied to the system. Manufacturers are constantly competing
  to deliver the fastest product, and as advancements in computer silicone slow down, manufacturers are also looking at alternative ways of improving performance; this results in high-power computer hardware being
  the priority. While giving computer hardware more power may seem the best because of the performance gains, it comes with its own set of drawbacks, such as a greater environmental impact, more heat and, depending
  on the application, a loss in practicality. This article will explore why power-efficient computers are important and why this aspect of computer hardware shouldn’t be overlooked.

<h3 id="Environmental_Importance">Environmental Importance</h3>
<p class="ex1" id= "EnvironmentalImportance_InText">
  With the ever-growing presence of global warming and the constant use of computers in our day-to-day operations, it is essential that we understand the impacts that computers have on our environment, varying
  from their energy usage to the footprint they leave during their manufacturing. 
   <br>
  Having more energy efficient computers will reduce the demand for energy which will lead to less greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. This is because the majority – about 85%  - of the earth’s energy is
  produced using forms of non-renewable energy (Cynthia Louise Grier , 2025). This is especially important now due to the expansion of datacentres to meet the demand for AI. Energy demand from datacentres has risen
  by around 12% per year since 2017, according to IEA (2025). 
   <br>
  Additionally, computers which consume more energy are typically more complex to manufacture and require more raw materials due to the need for more advanced cooling systems which furthers the environmental impact.
  An estimated 70%  of the energy required to make and operate a computer during its lifespan is used in the manufacturing process (Arizona State University, 2011).
